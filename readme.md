# Bug Game

This is team UltraBrew's submission for the 2021 homebrew game! Unfortunately we weren't able to complete a whole game, 
but we do have a neat little tech demo. The "game" uses libdragon with Snacchus's ugfx graphics microcode, making it one
of the first "games" to be built with this microcode. Another cool feature was that we were able to incorporate the bullet
physics engine, giving the game real time physics as well.

## Notes
This repo likely won't build as is. It uses a slightly modified version of Snacchus's branch, and I can update it to the
latest version after the game jam.
